  <p><b>Dear  Mr. Yerry Y Williams</b></p><br>
  <p>I'm delighted to have you inform about our December project. As l previously stated that I am done with the payment of the semester (tuition) and rent (6 months). Which of course have affected my business and dragging into lot of challenges here, as such;   transportation, limited selling time etc. But I am going to handle it gradually for now</p> 
  <p>All l need from you is to have me on your agenda specifically. I know your situation but you are my only hope for now. I'm also working hard here to put
  things in order for the next semester as soon as possible. I'm going to give all my sweat and blood to achieve this dream. No time, the time is now and now</p>
  <p>Thanks for your usual cooperation.<br>God bless you and watches over you.</p><br>
  <p><b>Mr. Elijah H. Neufville ll</b><br><b>Motto:</b> We can be great, regardless our status.</p>
